## Presentation

### What is this project?

WARNING - This project is not finished!

Gaussian Splatting API is a REST API to generate 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes from a set of images.

It is a wrapper around [MrNERF/gaussian-splatting-cuda](https://github.com/MrNeRF/gaussian-splatting-cuda).

### TODO

- [x] Compile gaussian-splatting-cuda with Docker
- [ ] Support upload of assets
- [ ] Support download of scenes

### License

The server wrapping code is open-source, but the code engine [gaussian-splatting-cuda](https://github.com/MrNeRF/gaussian-splatting-cuda) is based on [project by the Inria and the Max Planck Institut for Informatik (MPII)](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting).

This is a [publicly funded project](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/) with a [non-commercial license](GAUSSIAN-SPLATTING-LICENCE.md).

### So I can't use it for commercial apps?

You will have to talk with the original rightholders at the INRIA and MPII.

Also, please tell me if you know about any alternative project with a fully permissive open-source licensing.


## Running on your machine

### Prerequisites

You need a machine with CUDA, a GPU etc

### Environment variables

- `STORAGE_PATH`: on HF use `/data`, on a local you can use `.sandbox/`

### Deployment to Hugging Face

This can take some time.

note: this is a long build (~30 min)
